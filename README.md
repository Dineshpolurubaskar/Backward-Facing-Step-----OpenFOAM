# Backward-Facing-Step-----OpenFOAM

This project is a demonstration of backward faing step of a block using OpenFOAM simulation. 
It demonstrates the turbulent flow in the step near the wall and the results have been observed. 
SimpleFoam tutorials block has been used and the BlockMeshDict has been changed according to the size specified.
